# N-BodySimulation1

Simulates the gravitational forces between n objects in space, iterates through each object and computes the forces on that object exerted by all the other objects in the space. Static masses cannot move, massless dynamic objects are affected by the gravity of all other objects but do not exert forces on other objects. Normal dynamic objects are affected by all other objects and have mass themselves

# Controls:
Space Bar  - Places static object\
Left Click - Enters massless dynamic object placing, right click to place object - Objects placed with left click do not have mass\
e - Enters dynamic object placing, right click to place object - Objects placed with right click do have mass\
q - Toggles path overlay
